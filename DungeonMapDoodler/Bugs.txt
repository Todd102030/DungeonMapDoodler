October 8 2023:
Things to do before releasing current stuff to public
- Add link to classic version
- Get ads working on new map
- Images in tooltips for different tools
- Finish up new website design
- Refresh the How To page, maybe add some pictures as well



Todo Bugfixes:
Add cursor outline to line draw tool - not lining up on zoom
Right click acts as draw as well

Fixes to mobile use, offline support

DONE set showingPopup to true when saving image, saving file, text editing

Confirm popup when deleting layers
Add option to duplicate a layer

Hatching doesn't fill entire length of line tool

Fix weird fuzziness/colour transparency when outside grid is disabled

Finish floor tiles

DONE Create a framebuffer image, composite all images onto it, only rerender it when necessary
  lets us only draw a single item to the actual screen each frame
  
DONE Border and hatch size option for all drawing tools


Make text and stamps be layer specific

Change undo buttons to factor in stamps and text as well


AUGUST 4 2022 TODO:
Add more hatching options, more realistic map textures

Vector layers
 - Inkarnate has a background and foreground layer, background is basically my current hatch layer, foreground is my doodle layer. Rather than having outline layer just be drawing slightly bigger than the doodle layer, figure out how to do various effects based on the boundaries of the doodle layer. Like, an outline/outer shadow, a ripple effect, etc. Interior shadows as well, but that would need to be a new layer I think

Keyboard shortcuts bar - suggestions for common stuff. Needs to update on tool change and on shift click. 
More hover effects for tooltips and such
Revamp ui in general, make things look nicer
Widen stamp interface/sidebar
Chrome reloads entire stamp popup when it opens, need to show/hide and not rebuild html unless necessary
* Painter mode that lets you paint textures(hatches) into only already drawn map area. Option to switch between drawing inside of foreground (doodle map) or background
    * More options for brushes, not just a fuzzy circle
* Draw onto a temporary overlay layer and then "paste" it onto the actual doodle layer when done so that the outline doesn't disappear entirely from the map when drawing new stuff. 
    - Can fbCanvas be leveraged for this? 
    - On mouseup, take overlay canvas and draw to current layer
* In world map mode, hatching should be disabled, treat hatch layer and doodle layer as background and foreground as two separate things
* make things like outline thickness and other size sliders global
* More svg filter options and an easy way to switch between them similar to popup for background selector
* Add a popup hatching selector just like the style/stamp popups
Refer to svg filters as "Dynamic Brushes" or some buzzwordy thing
  --Worth keeping: ripple1, noise, squiggly-1
  * Things like baseFrequency, give user a slider to adjust
Place for all theme settings grouped together for easy editing, maybe just more stuff in global settings area?
Putting Wall Thickness into the negatives looks really cool, shifts all outline to the top left
Move global options and layers to floatingControlsLeft
Move Dynamic Brush selector into doodle tool paramBox, rename to Brush Tool
Get Mike's data-hover code from trusa and use it for hover tips
Drawing hatch layer possibly needs to be theme edited option that toggles code on doodle draw


*****HIGHEST PRIORITIES
 - Make it possible to draw different types of floor map/hatching onto single layer - DONE
 - Improve text layers
   - Put edit box into side menu, update oninput so map updates live
   - Add colour options for text and drop shadow options
   - Add full rotation similar to stamps
   - If possible, add curvy text using bezier curves or something
- Fix any broken stuff related to change of drawCursor - stamp and text highlights, wall and line tools
* After creating a new map, need to wipe out undo/redo stack


***FOR EACH NEW UPDATE***
- Edit serviceworker.js if new files added, ensure cache version is updated
- manifest.json, make sure is pointing to correct domain/folder
- make sure isBeta is set correctly
