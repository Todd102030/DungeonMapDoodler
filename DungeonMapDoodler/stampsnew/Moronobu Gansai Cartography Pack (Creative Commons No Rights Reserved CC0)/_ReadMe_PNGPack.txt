Moronobu Gansai PNG Pack: A 17th Century Cartography Brush Set for Fantasy Maps
Version 1.0

The first set in a planned duo is based on 東海道分間絵図 or Map of the Tōkaidō, a 17th-century watercolor map painted enormous scrolls by Hishikawa Moronobu. My most extensive set to date, over 1140 brushes, allows for the creation of works that feel more like picturesque landscapes that stand apart from typical fantasy maps. It is a unique approach to any fantasy map and perfect if you're looking to create something that evokes an elegant Edo-Period style. 
This is the PNG Pack. In the past, these weren't separated, which made using them outside of Photoshop/GIMP/Affinity Photo/Procreate much more difficult. They have been divided into individual files, making them easier to drag and drop. If you're looking for the .ABR set, it can be downloaded from: kmalexander.com

More details on this set and other brushes can be found at: kmalexander.com

Thanks for downloading this brush set, and I hope you find it useful.
