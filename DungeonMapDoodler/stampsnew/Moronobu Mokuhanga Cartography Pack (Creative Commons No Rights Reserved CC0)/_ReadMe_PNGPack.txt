Moronobu Mokuhanga PNG Pack: A 17th Century Cartography Brush Set for Fantasy Maps
Version 1.0

Moronobu Mokuhanga, the second set in The Moronobu Duo, is based on the 17th-century work of Hishikawa Moronobu. This set is extracted from 東海道分間絵図 (A Charted Map of the Tōkaidō). Whereas the first set in this duo, Gansai, was washes of ink and watercolor, today's set is firmly in Hishikawa's wheelhouse, a solid example of the ukiyo-e (浮世絵) woodblock work he made famous, which works particularly well for fantasy maps. Mokuhanga is my most extensive brush set, featuring over 2000 brushes! 

This is the PNG Pack. In the past, these weren't separated, which made using them outside of Photoshop/GIMP/Affinity Photo/Procreate much more difficult. They have been divided into individual files, making them easier to drag and drop. If you're looking for the .ABR set, it can be downloaded from: kmalexander.com

More details on this set and other brushes can be found at: kmalexander.com

Thanks for downloading this brush set, and I hope you find it useful.
